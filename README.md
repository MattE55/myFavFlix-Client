# myFavFlix-Client

This project is used as a learning experience for me to grasp how to code with react and pull from databases I created. 

When completed, the My Favorite Flix app will let the user browse a movie database and create their own library of their favorite movies. The movie database will include a main page with all of the movies, director pages with the directors info and their movies movies, and finally a genre page with the movies corrosponding to that genre. The User will have their own profile page with their info and favorite movies.
